# chess

### Overview

- I am a huge fan of chess so I wanted to build my own version in ruby.

### Instructions

- To play this game clone the game into a folder and simply run the chess.rb file in your console

### Technical details

**Moves:**  
- Valid moves for each piece are generated by looking first at how the piece moves.  
- An Array is then generated on all the possible moves a piece could make.
- That array then goes through another filter that checks to see if any of those moves will cause the current player's king to be in check.
**Check and Checkmate:**
- The check method looks through all the opposite player's pieces and sees if the current player's king is inside one of those spaces.
- If a player is in check the checkmate method looks to see if the player has any valid moves (because the valid moves are filtered for check).
